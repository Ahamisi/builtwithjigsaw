## How to add a site
- Fork this repo
- Clone your fork locally
- Run `addsite.sh` in the root project directory
- Add a screenshot of your site to `source/assets/images/sites/your-site-name.png`, using the same base file name as the markdown file generated by `addsite.sh`. E.g. if your resulting markdown file is `my-site.md`, name your screenshot file `my-site.png`
- Optional: run `composer install && npm install && npm run dev`, so you can preview your changes locally
